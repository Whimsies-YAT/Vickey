# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in Misskey, please report it by **[this form](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/new)**.

If you find a security issue in Vickey, please report the issue via **both the form above and [this form](https://github.com/Whimsies-YAT/misskey/security/advisories/new)**.
Vickey is a soft fork of Misskey now, so it is more dependent on Misskey for fixes at this time.

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository.

Additionally, for the safety of the entire community, we ask that you do not spread the vulnerability until a fix is released.

Thanks for helping make Misskey safe for everyone.

> When creating a security advisory, all content must be written in English (it is acceptable to include a non-English description along with the English one).

## When create a patch

If you can also create a patch to fix the vulnerability, please create a PR on the private fork.
